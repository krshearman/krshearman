## 👤 About Me 
Hi there 👋
My name is Kendall. I recently (10DEC24) joined the GitHub team as a Customer Reliability Engineer III. This space showcases a little bit about me, but if you'd like to learn more, feel free to get in touch on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/krshearman) 

### 💼 Professional Background
Originally educated in the humanities, I taught EFL abroad for many years 🌏. I became interested in tech around 2007 when I grew bored of grading papers and was searching for a way to automate the process with a learning management system. My fascination with LMS, CMS, and modular programming continues to this day! After a few years dabbling with code as a hobbyist, I eventually committed to computer science in 2018 when I returned to school to study the field formally 🎓. Since then, I've had the good fortune to work in both the FAANG and startup worlds in a variety of roles 🧑‍💻. 

### Current Work
While onboarding, I made this amazing Octocat:
